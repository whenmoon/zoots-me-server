# zootsme

Zoots Me allows users to have their outfits rated! Take a snap and and while you're waiting for people to rate it, rate other people's.

Inherited as a legacy project and as a team of two, we re-built the Firebase back-end using Express and MongoDB so we could write tests using Jest and SuperTest. We also wrote tests for the front-end using Jest and Enzyme.

This project is a work in progress.

Front-end repo is [here](https://github.com/whenmoon/zootsme).
